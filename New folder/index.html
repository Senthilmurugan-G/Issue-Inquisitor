                     such as the ability to submit complaints via a web form or email, track the status of complaints, receive notifications of new complaints, assign complaints to specific team members, and generate reports on complaint data.
                    The benefits of using the system: such as improved customer satisfaction, increased efficiency in handling complaints, and better data tracking and analysis to identify and address common issues.
                    The company or organization behind the system: such as the name, contact information, and a brief overview of the company's mission and values.
